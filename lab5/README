before I wrote this lab, I merge the modification in lab4 that I did.
Including Ty_Int() in types.c and initialization of the kind of E_eventry in env.c (it's intresting that this file changed in this lab)
I also copy the old semant.c from lab4 and modified it to adopt this new lab.
To identify a loop variable, I modify the structure of Ty_Ty_, too

OK, previews is done. Let't go back to work!
